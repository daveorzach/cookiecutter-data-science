**  Description:       This file contains table generation queries used to
**                     prepare available data for feature generation.
**                     Note - This file is used for model development in
**                     addition to model scoring and update therefore should be
**                     "script like" code (e.g. all create tables, can be run
**                     end-to-end without intervention, setup to take new data
**                     as it is made available)
**  Input Tables:      * <table used in this script>
**                     * <table used in this script>
**  Output Table:      * N/A (Ideally data exploration should not create tables)
